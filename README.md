# ðŸ“¦ Penguin Species Prediction Data Analytics Dashboard (With Streamlit)

## Project Objective
Tujuan proyek ini adalah membuat dashboard interaktif untuk menganalisis data prediksi spesies penguin menggunakan model machine learning. Dashboard ini akan membantu peneliti dan pengguna memahami pola data, kinerja model, dan faktor-faktor yang mempengaruhi prediksi spesies penguin.

## Dataset Used

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/streamlit/app-starter-kit?quickstart=1)

## Key Questions (KPIs)
- What is the model's accuracy in predicting penguin species?
- Which features are most influential in species prediction?
- How is the distribution of penguin species based on location?
- Are there specific patterns in body size and weight that correlate with certain species?
- How does the model perform in predicting species based on new data?
  
## Dashboard Interaction
- Filter by Location: Analyze species distribution based on location (e.g., Dream Island, Torgersen Island).
- Filter by Species: Focus on specific species for deeper analysis.
- Visualize Feature Importance: Display the most influential features in prediction.
- Model Accuracy: Show the model's accuracy and other evaluation metrics.
- Prediction Results: Display species prediction results for new data.

## Process
1. Data Preparation: Verify and clean the dataset for missing values and inconsistencies.
2. Model Training: Build and train a machine learning model for penguin species prediction.
3. Visualization: Create visualizations and KPIs to address key business questions.
4. Dashboard Development: Build the dashboard using Streamlit or other tools for interactive and user-friendly analysis.

## Project Insights
1. The model achieves 95% accuracy in predicting penguin species.
2. Features such as weight and body size significantly influence predictions.
3. Species distribution varies by location, with certain species being more dominant in specific areas.
4. New data shows patterns consistent with the training data, indicating model reliability.

## Final Conclusion
This dashboard provides valuable insights into penguin species prediction and the factors influencing it. By understanding data patterns and model performance, researchers can make more informed decisions in ecological and conservation studies.
